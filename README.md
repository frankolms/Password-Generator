# Password-Generator

This is a password generator that takes in inputs from the user to output a password that meets those parameters.

When the user presses the Generate Password button, the user is presented with a prompt alert that asks them to input a number value between 8 and 128 that will determine the length of the password. The user is then presented with numerous confirm alerts that ask if they would like to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their password. The user must answer yes to at least one of these prompts. Once the user correctly inputs a length for the password and answers yes to at least one of the confirm alerts, a password is generated and then displayed in the box with placeholder text that says Your Secure Password.

If the user inputs a number outside of the 8 - 128 character requirement, or the user says no to all of the confirm prompts, it will ask the user to try again.
